Fork of the original SurfaceToTUIO program found in the Squidy Interaction Library. Original authors Toni Schmidt and Martin Kaltenbrunner.

This fork fixes the following:

* Last finger/fiducial not being removed properly.
* It also sends out messages only if anything has changed, avoiding to spam and overload certain clients (\*cough\* Flash implementations, \*cough\*).
